## UX 
### Strategy - User Story
There are 03 types of users for this website 
* Owner (superuser)
* Registered User (user)
* Public (anonymous user)

#### Owner (superuser) Goals 
* List & sell digital marketing and related services via the platform 
* Delete irrelevant products 
* Edit products that change in scope or description 

The site owner would ideally use this platform to allow clients to make direct purchases for services he provides. This is more efficient compared to traditional email quotation and offers pricing transparency. 

#### Registered User (user) Goals 
* The site should attract user to make purchases. 
* By viewing the brief portfolio on the index page, the user can choose to purchase services or ready made assets such as stock photo off the platform. 

#### Annonymous User Goals 
* To view projects and the portfolio of Kanga Design.
* Showcase digital assets and our ability to produce quality assets for purchase. 

### Scope
* Content: 
    * Text 
    * Icons 
    * Banner Images
    * Placeholder work images 
* Functional: 
    * Search function for name of service 
    * Search function for category 

### Structure
![Skeleton](image/skeleton.png)

The 3-click rule was applied for UX strategy when designing the structure of the site. Despite numerous prototyping to work around the steps for payment methods, the best UX strategy was eventually to allow a redirect to stripe to make payment there. 
Users are still able to get from index page to check out page in 3-steps. 

#### Skeleton
#### Index Page
With inspiration from SunBird Creative, I decided to follow a simple visual structure for the site's skeleton. The reason was due to the work and products being the center of focus rather than unconventional layout or designs.

#### Sales Page (Similar for Digital Assets and Services e-commerce page)
Sales page structure is clean and easy to navigate. I wanted a side search column for people to search for the types of product they are looking for.

#### Surface
Only 3 colors were used for the site. Mustard yellow, Light Grey and White. These color are consistent with the brand identity of KANGA. 
Typography used was Roboto and Calibri. 



## Database Design 
![ER Diagram](image/erd.png)
ER Diagram shows the initial design for the backend of the website. A discount entity was present, but, as mentioned above, due to time constraints, it was omitted in this version. Discount entity will be implemented for future updates to encourage users to make purchases with a discount coupon.

## Methods used programming 
1. Use of a environment file (.env) to store sensitive information together with a GitIgnore file to prevent pushing said information to github. 
2. GitHub was use for source control of code.
3. Heroku was chosen to deploy the project. 

## Features
### Account Authentication
Annonymous users may sign up for an account so they may make direct purchase on our site. 

### Shopping Cart to make purchase
Shopping cart can accumulate products from Services and Assets and give a grand total before checkout for consideration. 

### Create, Edit and Delete Services and Assets on page as a superuser
Superuser can easily edit/delete individual product on the product card. 

### Search Functions
Users may key in keywords on the search bar and make a search for the services they are looking for. They may also search base on the category of the products.

### Email verification
When a user sign up, an email verification will be sent to their email. Only when they confirm will they be added as an user. 
For testing purposes, you may use https://www.mailinator.com/ to create a temporary email. 

### Required form fields validation 
There is form validation provided by Django to set certain fields as required. This prevents missing out on fields which are essential for the website. 


## Features left to implement 
1. A discount field to be added so that we can create vouchers for ease of application to the product. Discount field is already a model within the application. Next step is to integrate the discount field to the code. 
2. A static portfolio page displaying videos of the work done. This page will be a brochure for clients who would like to find out more about what we do.
